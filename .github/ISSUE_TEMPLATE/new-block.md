## Description

Describe what the block is meant to do, represent, or who is meant to use it. Outline the backend 

## Needs

What is required to be made for this new block?

### Back-end

Describe how the editor-side layout will look and what the user can expect. Include a list of `attributes` WordPress will use to manage state.

### Front-end

Describe the layout including screenshots or mockups.

### Behavior

A description of the blocks behavior. How will this be achieved? Front-end script, API endpoint, etc.

e.g.
- [ ] block controller
    - finds all internal element `x`'s, changes their style to `red`, and sets their text to their ID
- [ ] api endpoint `/api/wp-json/guten-csek-example-api`
    - searches the back end for a user's short name, returns JSON in the format `{ name: string, id: number }` 

### Dependencies

What must be completed before this block is able to be started/functional?

e.g. 

- Depends on #XX
- Requires `Another Block` to be present on the page for full functionality

## Expected Delivery Time

How long do you think this will take you to complete? Consider how many dependencies it has and the size of other blocks. Give an answer in the form of "hours spent" or "will be delivered by yyyy-mm-dd"
